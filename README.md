# cache-xmlhttprequests-vanillajs
This script is used by us to cache XMLHTTPRequests in SPAs.

This script only makes sense if server-side rendering is used.
The file will intercept ALL XMLHTTPRequests and reply with a cached version of the response.

Development is on-going, some critical features may be still missing.

Visit [caching.guru](https://caching.guru) for more information.
